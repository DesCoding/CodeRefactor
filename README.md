# Homework-1 Read Me Page
Objective:  Make Horiseon's webpage accessible.
The following chnages have been made:
Horiseon Home Page was added to the header section in html to fix the page title.
I validated semantic HTML elements to ensue proper syntax
    - added header tags
    - changed the <div> tag to <nav> around the link section because this section contains links to navigate to data
    - removed <div class="content"> and replaced with <main>
    - replaced div udner main with section
    - replaced class with ID
    - updated CSS .header nav styling (removed div from header)
    - updated CSS .header nav ul styling label
    - updated CSS labels to reflect correct semantic html tags
    - added section and footer tags to html 
    - updated class for each benefit in html and consolodated the css since all styling was the same for lead, brand, and cost.
    - added comments to css changes
    - validated links
    - add alt mouseover info to img in html
    - added id and class to search engine optimization img section to make the link work

    Tried to clean up CSS more but it caused the page to break.  Will research ways to streamline CSS and offer free debugging to my client until April 2021.
