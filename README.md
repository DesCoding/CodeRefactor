# Homework-1 Read Me Page
To make Horiseon's webpage accessible, the following chnages have been made:
Title:  Horiseon Home Page was added to the header section in html
I validated semantic HTML elements to ensue proper syntax
    - added header tags
    - changed the <div> tag to <nav> around the link section because this section contains links to navigate to data
    - removed <div class="content"> and replaced with <main>
    - replaced div udner main with section
    - replaced class with ID
